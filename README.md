## Intro

This repository contains the projects for the course `Software Engineering 1` at the University of Tehran. The first 4 projects are done individually and the rest are done in a group of 3, for the individual ones the corresponding version of each member is placed in the Assignment folder. The projects are done in Java and the details of each project can be found in the corresponding folder. Extra references and resources for each project are also placed in the `HELP.md` file in each folder.

## Assignment 0

In this assignment, we were supposed to implement a simple console-based application that reads a CSV file and prints the data in a table format. This project was just for getting familiar with Java and Maven.

## Assignment 1

In this assignment, we were supposed to implement a simple JMS application using Spring Boot and Artemis. The application is a simple chat application that uses JMS to send and receive messages.

## Assignment 2

This assignment was about code review and refactoring. We were given a simple Java application as `TinyME` (a simple matching engine) and we were supposed to review the code and refactor it.

## Assignment 3

In this assignment, we were supposed to add complementary unit tests to the `TinyME` application to increase the code coverage. The tests were supposed to be written using JUnit and Mockito. Each individual was supposed to write the tests for the corresponding version of the `TinyME` application, and then we added the tests to the main `TinyME` folder.

## Assignment 4

In this assignment, we were supposed to add a simple feature to the `TinyME` application. The feature was to add a minimum execution quantity to the orders. The feature was supposed to be implemented in a way that the existing tests would not fail. This feature shows that an order will be moved into the order book only if the quantity of the order is greater than or equal to the minimum execution quantity. For more information, please refer to the description file in the `A4` folder.
